				<h2>About Me </h2>
				<p>I was born in Torrance, CA and grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. I went to school for fine art. Some of my favorite artists include John Marin, Rene Magritte, Wasily Kandinsky, John Sargent and Mark Rothko. My hobbies include painting, rock climbing, yoga, reading, hiking, and swimming. I live in Chicago with my two cats, Hawk and Radar. I'm currently taking a course at Dev Bootcamp to learn web development. This is one of my projects. </p>
				<p>My friend says I come off as serious to some people but to her it's funny in an unexpected way. I don't try to be funny. It's hard to point out a "quirky" thing. I'm sure I have a few quirky things about me. </p>
